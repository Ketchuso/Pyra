# Pyra

## What Is It?
Pyra is a site that gives people an area to discuss articles and fact check them
*It does this by:*
- Allowing users to submit articles, with their respective links and titles
- Having the ability to add fact checks under the articles, with a link to a source
- The Ability to comment
- the ability to rate Articles, fact checks, and comments
- finally, the articles are sorted by a hotness algorithm by default, but can be switched to new

## How to use it
1. clone the repo into your local environment
2. install the dependencies, npm install for the front end (within the client director) and pipenv install for the backend (within the server directory)
3. run your pipenv within the server directory and run python app.py
4. run the front end by using npm start within the client directory

## The Mission
The overall mission for Pyra is to create an environment that tries to filter out the biases of major news networks, by letting fact checking and discussions be done by anyone who wishes

## Roadmap
- adding more security to the links and user submitted info in general
- adding some more styling, make it look more polished
- publish it for public use
- adding minimal ads to the site to monetize and hopefully turn this into something bigger

## Contribution
This was a solo project, but anyone who wishes to help me add onto it, feel free to message me (Ketchuso) and I'll figure it out
